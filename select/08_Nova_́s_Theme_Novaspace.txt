Love Theme From "the Eyes Of Laura Mars" (prisoner)
LOVE THEME FROM EYES OF LAURA MARS
Barbra Streisand
I've never been alone
But you're the only one I'd trust
To show me the way
I always hear your voice
And in my dreams I hear you calling my name
What is it about you
Some kind of light shines from your face
And I can't turn away
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken, taken by surprise
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken, and I've been hypnotized
Your eyes say everything
You want to keep me here forever
I can't escape
One minute's so sincere
Then you completely turn against me
And I'm afraid
You don't have to say you love me
If you want me I'll stay
'Cause I can't turn away
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken, taken by surprise
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken and I've been hypnotized
