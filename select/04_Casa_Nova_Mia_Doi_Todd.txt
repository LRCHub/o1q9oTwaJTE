I can fall in love again.
I can feel the curse you cast is over.
No more no more Casanova.
Hip hip hurray, oh hallelujah.

I haven't changed much in these ten years.
I hit my head up against the wall
Of my same ol' fears, my same ol' fears,
My same ol' tears. I'm breaking mirrors.

I know myself again.
I remember what is good about me
If I let it out of hiding,

My enemy, proven to keep me down
Love as a memory of kindness
And cruelty and cruelty
And honesty and true beauty.

I can fall in love again.
I can feel the curse I cast is over.
No more no more Casanova.
Hip hip hurray, oh Supernova,
Supernova, Supernova, Four-Leaf Clover.
